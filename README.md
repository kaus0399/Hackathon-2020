# Hackathon-2020
Project for 2020 Hackathon
This is a basic Hackathon project that uses node.js, express and mongoDB to create a collection of Psychological resources
on the UC Davis campus. 

There are issues with the GET route as geoNear is no longer supported on the latest version of mongoose. Any Help is appreciated.
